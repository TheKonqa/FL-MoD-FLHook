; This is the configuration for the jumpdrives as implemented by the 
; player control plugin. There are two types of jumpdrive device
; a jumpdrive and a survey module. The survey module is used to find
; hyperspace coordinates and the jumpdrive is used to jump to these
; coordinates.

; To use this plugin, you need to add jumpdrive and survey modules to
; your mod. On discovery we used shield equipment with custom names.

[general]
; If a player jumps into these systems, they die.
